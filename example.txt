Hello! I'm a bot that can talk to you about books. (If our conversation reaches a dead end, it means that we are not on the same path sorry)
(user): Yo 
(bot): Hello! How can I assist you?
(user): what is your favorite book? 
(bot): My two favorites are 'We' by Evgeny Zamyatin and 'Gone with the Wind' by Margaret Mitchell. 'We' provides a glimpse into the future and see what life might look like in a society where individual freedom and individuality are suppressed for the greater good. I like 'Gone with the Wind' a lot because it's a great historical novel that describes the lives of people during the American Civil War. The book leaves an unforgettable impression and makes you think about life and values.
(user): can you recommend me something to read? 
(bot): What genre of books do you like?
(user): Utopia 
(bot): Utopia! I also like to read books about utopian worlds because they give me the opportunity to imagine myself as a hero who helps create an ideal world. Do you want me to recommend the 5 best books in this genre?
(user): yes 
(bot): I am pleased to provide you with a list of the top five books in the utopian genre:
1. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is a classic book that tells the story of life in an ideal society where people live without disease or conflict but at a high price.
2. '1984' by George Orwell is a novel that describes a totalitarian world where the government controls all aspects of people's lives. The book warns us against what can happen if the government becomes too powerful.
3. 'Opium for the People' by Eugene Zamiatin is a book that describes the life of people in a single state, where every inhabitant has his own number, and the government controls all aspects of their lives.
4. Plato's 'State' is an ancient book that describes an ideal society based on justice and reason. The book is the basis for many modern utopias.
5. 'Return from the Future' by Robert Heinlein is a book that tells about a future society where human rights and freedoms are recognized as more important than any other values. This book is one of the most famous and popular in the genre.
